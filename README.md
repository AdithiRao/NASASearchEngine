Nasa Project

This project is a search engine that utilizes the NASA Api to query images.
The webpages allow the user to type in anything they want to search for in
the NASA image database, and the results will be returned back to them in an
orderly fashion. The results returned include the image, a link to the jpg,
date created, title, center and location.

The user can also filter their results using the filter option at the top.
